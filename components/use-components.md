# ðŸ¥½ Use Components

After some time after you are using adventure components inside your project, you get to the point, you wish, you would have some assistive functions, which help you to more easily work with them.&#x20;

Of course, Stacked also provides some helpful features, to get this working!

## Base-Functions

The most default check functions of Strings are most likely the isBlank and isEmpty functions, Stacked also provides these functions for Components!

We have the `content()` function, which reads the content of the Component as plain text. This helps us to get nearer to our goal!

Now, after we have the content function, we are also directly providing extension functions for the Components, like the `isBlank()`, `isNotBlank()`, `isEmpty()` and `isNotEmpty()` functions!
