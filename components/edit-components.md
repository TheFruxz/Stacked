# ðŸªš Edit Components

Not only the creation of Components is important for production use, but also to work with them and modify them so that they fit your needs!

For 'modification' Stacked provides some extension functions, that are helping to work with them in your production environment.

## Replacing

One of the extensions is the extension of easy-to-use replace functions.

Simply use the `replace` keyword on your component and see! Now you can use replace kinda like working with a String replace!

## Style

Stacked also provides direct-access functions for styles, so you don't have to explicitly create new Styles over and over again.

Just use the `style` keyword on your component and see!

## Color

Stacked provides default-color functions like `dyeBlack`, `dyeBlue`, `dyeGold` and much more (always with the dye prefix) but also the infix function `dye`, with which you can directly set a color, which can be a TextColor or even an AscendColor from the Ascend library!

{% hint style="warning" %}
The **AscendColor** is part of another Library, called _**Ascend**_! The Ascend library is part of the big group of libraries, in which this library is also contained!
{% endhint %}
