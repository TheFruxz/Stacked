## üëã Welcome to Stacked

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

### Repository

How can I use Stacked in my own projects? For this you need to know what your project is based on, or should be based on.
We ourselves recommend that you use `Gradle Kotlin` in all your projects, but you can also use other systems like `Gradle` and `Maven`!

#### Using JitPack
##### Repository
```kotlin
maven("https://jitpack.io")
```

##### Dependency
```kotlin
implementation("com.github.TheFruxz:Stacked:$stackedVersion")
```

#### Using GitHub Packages
##### Repository 
```kotlin
maven("https://maven.pkg.github.com/TheFruxz/Stacked") {
        credentials {
            credentials {
                username = project.findProperty("gpr.user") as String? ?: System.getenv("USERNAME")
                password = project.findProperty("gpr.key") as String? ?: System.getenv("TOKEN")
            }
        }
    }
```

##### Dependency
```kotlin
implementation("de.fruxz:stacked:$stackedVersion")
```

#### üîê Auth

You need to have set the system variables `USERNAME` and `TOKEN` to your GitHub-Username and GitHub-Personal-Access-Token,
to access the packages via the GitHub-Packages Feature. You can also use the project variables `gpr.user` and `gpr.key`, but
don't publish them to the web!

## üóû Version

Since we always try to use the latest versions as soon as possible, as already described in the point 'Version Policy', current versions quickly become obsolete, so we will soon release a list of versions, where it will be shown exactly how long a certain version is still being supported.
